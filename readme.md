# Hi here!

Language.
* Can read and write fluently in English.

## 2023 update:  
### For tech:  
I guess ASP .NET and C# is best now, it is very suitable for the development of small and medium-sized teams, and the business level is far beyond golang or other language and platform.  

MUI is the great UI library for React, mui/joy looks awesome even the components under the development.  

### For buisness:
Fiapp is about to set up a proprietary fund and may attempt a first round of public financing and conversion to hedge funds next year.
